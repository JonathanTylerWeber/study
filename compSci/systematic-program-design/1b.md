<!-- How to design Functions -->

Example:

Design a function that consumes a number and produces twice that number

;; Number -> Number                  ; Signature
;; produce 2 times the given number  ; Purpose

(check-expect (double 3) 6)          ; Examples/tests
(check-expect (double 4.2) (* 2 4.2)) ; Examples/tests

;(define (double n) 0)               ; Stub
;(define (double n)                  ; Template
;   (... n))

(define (double n)                   ; Function body
  (* 2 n))

*********

Signature:
  declares type of data function consumes and produces

Purpose:
  1 line description of what the function produces in terms of what it consumes

Stub:
  function definition that has function name, correct number of params, produces dummy result of correct type

Examples/Tests:
  Examples help us understand what the function must do
  mulitple examples help to illustrate behavior
  wrapping in check-expect means they will also serve as unit tests for the completed function
  use the stub to make sure the tests actually run and expect them to fail

Template:
  function with right function name and parameter, and basic function body that will do something

Function Body:
  write the function, can elaborate on function examples to help write the actual function

Test:
  run tests and get them to pass


***********
Practice

String -> String
add an exclamation mark to the end of a string

(check-expect (yell("hi")) "hi!")

(define yell(str) '')

(define yell(str)
  ...str)

(define yell(str)
  string-append str "!")
